Welcome to the Offline RAG Chatbot System

This is a sample document to help you test the offline RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot system.

About the System:
- Uses Instructor-XL for creating embeddings from documents
- Stores vector embeddings in Qdrant database
- Uses Qwen-7B for generating intelligent responses
- Runs completely offline after initial setup
- Supports natural language questions about your documents

Features:
- Document chunking for better retrieval
- Semantic search using 768-dimensional embeddings
- Context-aware response generation
- Source attribution for transparency
- Modern web interface with real-time chat

How to Use:
1. Add your .txt documents to the documents folder
2. Run the preprocessing script to generate embeddings
3. Start the server and access the web interface
4. Ask questions about your documents

The system can answer questions about:
- Document content and topics
- Specific facts mentioned in the documents
- Relationships between different pieces of information
- Summaries and explanations based on the context

This sample document contains information about the RAG system itself, so you can ask questions like:
- "What embedding model does this system use?"
- "How does the system work?"
- "What are the main features?"
- "How do I add new documents?"

The system will search through all your documents and provide answers based on the most relevant content it finds.
